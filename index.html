                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Georgia Southern University in May 2016 with a Bachelor of General Studies degree with an emphasis in Information Systems and moved to Jacksonville, Florida immediately after. I was unable to find work in my field in Jacksonville, so I worked several medical front office jobs until I accepted an Office Automation position at Naval Hospital Jacksonville in January 2021. Not quite IS, but it was on the right track and helped revive my excitement for information management. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Six months after starting that position, my husband was transferred and we moved from Florida to Maryland. Shortly after the move, I started a position as a project analyst coordinating a large data transfer for PMA-274, the Presidential Helicopters Program, within the Naval Air Systems Command. After completing the data transfer, I was promoted to Computer Systems Analyst coordinating the PMAâ€™s move from an on-premises SharePoint Server to SharePoint Online and developing the new SharePoint Online site collection. SharePoint Developer has been my favorite position so far, and during my time in this position I have come to realize my passion: developing useful and efficient applications with a focus on user experience.
